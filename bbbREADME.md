# Barnsley Better Bond
The Barnsley Better Bond is a fund that supports community projects that align with the Better Barnsley Project, a vision to transform Barnsley as a place of opportunities. The fund is established from the contributions made by providers contracted by the council to perform works or services. The Barnsley Better Bond website is a new platform that provides information and guidance on how to apply for the fund, as well as links to the Barnsley 2030 ambitions that outline the council's priorities and goals.

# User Experience
The website is aimed at community groups and organisations who would be familiar with the website but struggle to navigate it due to the amount of content. 
## User Stories
* Users will use the website to understand what the fund is, who can apply for it and how to get in touch with the Council.
* They will have multiple ways to navigate through the site through buttons at the bottom of the page and or the sticky navigation.
The logo also activates the menu

# Features
The website in its current form aims to improve the quality of applications and discourage those who are not eligible from applying.

* **Logo activates the menu** - When hovering over the logo, the cursor changes to a hand. This helps experienced users notice that there is an action.

* **Video** – The video sets the scene where people can quickly understand the history of the town and why the fund exists.

* **Language** – It clearly states what we are looking for and who should apply. It is there to inspire and encourage the community to come together and help shape the future of the borough. 

* **Font size** – When opened on a laptop, the font size increases to accommodate those with poor vision.

* **Information** – There are many links to different policies, the council’s ambitions, organisations that are on the panel and where to get support if applicants are not eligible.

* **Accessibility** - If for some reason people do not find the menu, at the bottom of each page there is a link that will take the user to the next page.

## Features left to develop
* **Login** – To ensure applications are of a good quality, the website should have the ability to log in, save and alter applications, as well as track, upload monitoring and other evidence. Also, it should have helpful hints about Barnsley’s ambitions and what applicants could include to bolster their request for funding.

* **Past Projects** – The website should have links to the Facebook pages of the groups with more testimonies from community groups and the residents they have helped, including case studies and interviews that demonstrate the impact of the fund.

* **User Experience** – The website should enhance UX by having all other content fade when the menu is selected.


* **Navigation** – The website should support navigation around the site by underlining the page in the menu.

* **Application support** – The website should have a whole page dedicated to getting help with applications, funding and project idea development.

* **Legal** – The website should have a GDPR pop-up.
