# Barnsley Better Bond
The Barnsley Better Bond is a fund that supports community projects that align with the Better Barnsley Project, a vision to transform Barnsley as a place of opportunities. The fund is established from the contributions made by providers contracted by the council to perform works or services. The Barnsley Better Bond website is a new platform that provides information and guidance on how to apply for the fund, as well as links to the Barnsley 2030 ambitions that outline the council's priorities and goals.

## Menu ##

* **Site Navigation** - Users can access different parts of the site in various ways. One way is to use the navigation menu, which you can open by clicking on the burger menu icon or the logo. The logo also changes the cursor to a hand when you hover over it, indicating that it is clickable.

* The navigation bar highlights the selected page when the user hovers over it.

## Features left to develop
* **Login** – To ensure applications are of a good quality, the website should have the ability to log in, save and alter applications, as well as track, upload monitoring and other evidence. Also, it should have helpful hints about Barnsley’s ambitions and what applicants could include to bolster their request for funding.

### Content enhancement
* **Past Projects** – The website should have links to the Facebook pages of the groups with more testimonies from community groups and the residents they have helped, including case studies and interviews that demonstrate the impact of the fund.

* **Application support** – The website should have a whole page dedicated to getting help with applications, funding and project idea development.

### User Experience
* The website should enhance UX by having all other content fade when the menu is selected.

* Social media integration with Facebook 

* *Meet the Funders* events will be advertised on the site where people can get support with funding applications, the creation of projects, and developing business cases.

### Navigation
* The website should support navigation around the site by underlining the page in the menu.

* Enhancing the slide menu can be achieved by subdividing the About Us page into sections.

* Tests with the demographic show that a pop-up message or simply using the word "menu" aids navigation better. While the burger menu is familiar to frequent users, it may not be clear for older users.

* **Legal** – The website should have a GDPR pop-up.

# User Experience
The website is aimed at community groups and organisations who would be familiar with the website but struggle to navigate it due to the amount of content. 
### Target Audience
* If a smartphone is used, it will often be smaller versions, as they will view it as a device to make calls, not browse the internet.
* The majority of group leaders are retired.
* They will focus on human interaction, preferably face-to-face, but they will be  okay with calling.
* Not everyone will have email address.

## User Stories
* Users will use the website to understand what the fund is, who can apply for it and how to get in touch with the Council.
* They will have multiple ways to navigate through the site through buttons at the bottom of the page and or the sticky navigation.
The logo also activates the menu
