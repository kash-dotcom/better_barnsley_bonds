            <p> Barnsley Council's Stronger Communities service works alongside other partners to be
                the catalyst
                for social change and to improve the quality of life across the Barnsley Borough. It
                is committed to fostering resilient and capable communities and to building capacity
                among citizens, enabling them to contribute to a brighter future and a better
                Barnsley. The service encompasses six Area Teams that are responsible for area
                governance, commissioning arrangements, and community engagement. Their work is
                significant in early intervention and prevention, contributing to the health and
                well-being of the community.</p>
